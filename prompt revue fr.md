Go to my gmail and the links I give you below and make me a summary of all my newsletters about AI for the week that just ended
I will give you the last day to revue
 
I want a bullet point answer with the main news concerning AI 
I want a title for each news with two lines of description / text 
rank me these news by VIRALITÉ (how many sources cover the same story):
- First, cross-reference all news across all 10 sources
- Count how many sources mention each news item
- Rank from most viral (6+ sources) to least viral (1 source)
- Display the source count for each news (e.g., "Alpha Signal, TLDR AI • 2 sources")

I want at least 25 news with three zones : critical (high viralité 3+ sources), important (medium viralité 2 sources), good to know (single source)

use only these newsletters in a balance way, from my gmail account, ensuring that they are all equally represented :
Alpha Signal, Mozza Bytes, Upmynt, NLP Newsletter, The AI Report, TLDR AI, 
Andreas Horn / human in the loop, Daphnée de IA Ethique Insider, 
Superhuman – Zain K, AI Tidbits.
your goal here is to scan my emails with the gmail tool until you find all these newsletters for the week that just ended

use only these newsletters in a balance way, ensuring that they are all equally represented

if you don't find the newsletters email go through their urls below and use these scraping tools : parallel search, parallel task, firecrawl, tavily, sequential thinking

these are the urls to scrap :

I trust you to do a balanced summary with all the sources : this is very important

Use the ai_newsletter_minimal.html file as a template

below the title you must write down design by Dagorsey & Claude
below this you must write down the start and end date of the week
below this date you must write down that the sources are available at the end of the newsletter
at the end of the newsletter you must write down all the sources you used for this news letter specifically

the title of the weekly review will always be "AI Weekly"

please provide the precise and unique link for each news

be a hundred times more specific
